# nagios-check-wordpress_spam

Nagios Plugins for checking number of wordpress comment unders a certain time.

Check all comments posted in the last 4 hours to avoid a Spam campaign. I need a warning threshold 
set on 4 comments in last 4 hours, and a critical threshold set on 10 comments in last 4 hours.
